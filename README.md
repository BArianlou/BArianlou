## Technical Frameworks
### Quanta — Self-Optimizing Probability Engine

A physics-based engine designed to model **Discrete State Entropy** and **Systemic Criticality** in high-variance systems. Unlike static regression models that assume constant decay, Quanta utilizes a **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** layer to mathematically derive friction coefficients and entropy weights from historical data in real-time.

*   **Core Logic:** Operates as a closed-loop solver. Inputs raw telemetry and utilizes `scipy.optimize` (L-BFGS-B) to minimize error, deriving the hidden physics constants ($\beta$, $\mu$, $\epsilon$) that drive system decay. Features **Adaptive Drift Detection** to trigger recalibration when reality diverges from the model.
*   **Validation Case:** Monte Carlo simulations (N=5,000) confirmed a **1.42 Unit Advantage** per crisis event by correctly identifying "Coupled Instability" (The Chain Effect) where traditional heuristics failed.
*   **Status:** Public documentation · White Paper released · Core logic proprietary.

### Apex Expert 2.0 — Hybrid Intelligence Architecture  
A multi-layer intelligence synthesis engine using M9–M10 architecture for data orchestration, decision support, and strategic campaign design.  
**Status:** Documentation public · Core logic proprietary · Access by alignment only.

### Chronos — RL Liquidity Execution Framework  
Reinforcement-driven framework for **institutional liquidity execution** and **slippage optimization**. Focused on execution sequencing, market impact modeling, and adaptive policy learning in adversarial microstructure environments.  
**Status:** Public framework · Research-grade RL engine.

### Sypher — Post-Quantum Cryptographic Framework  
Post-quantum cryptographic framework fusing **Kyber-style KEM** with **AES-256-GCM** and RL-driven adversarial resilience. Targets secure key exchange, encrypted channels, and robustness against adaptive threat models.  
**Status:** Public framework · PQC + adversarial resilience.

### Vantage — Stochastic Physics-Integrated Predictive Engine
The first production-grade synthesis of the **Apex** (Ingestion) and **Chronos** (Simulation) frameworks. A generalizable predictive framework built on **Stochastic Physics-Integrated Predictive Analysis (SPIPA)**. Models complex competitive systems as dynamic physical environments characterized by energy states, transition potentials, and entropy.

*   **Core Logic:** Integrates **Apex** data orchestration with **Chronos** Monte Carlo kernels to transform raw telemetry into physics-aligned state representations (10,000 runs/event).
*   **Validation Case:** Currently deployed on **NFL datasets** as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate probabilistic arbitrage capabilities against institutional baselines.
*   **Status:** Private engine · White Paper released · Core logic sealed.
### Flux — Cybernetic Entropic Simulation Engine

A general-purpose recursive state machine designed to model friction, decay, and entropy in complex adaptive systems. Unlike standard regression models that predict destination, Flux simulates the journey by accounting for **Path Dependency**, **Hysteresis**, and **Cybernetic Feedback Loops**.

*   **Core Logic:** Operates as a closed-loop reactor. Inputs static potential energy (from Vantage) and processes it through a **Stochastic Transition Kernel** to simulate system decay and critical failures (e.g., liquidity cascades, supply chain bottlenecks, turnover spirals).
*   **Validation Case:** Utilized as the "Chronos" layer to resolve high-variance anomalies in competitive game theory, successfully identifying "Tail Risks" that statistical averages miss.
*   **Status:** Private engine · White Paper released · Core logic sealed.

## Sealed Engines (Private Deployment)

These systems are **operational, versioned, and banked**, with logic retained as proprietary assets.

*   **Quanta — Self-Optimizing Probability Engine**
    MLE-driven solver designed to derive hidden physics constants ($\beta, \mu, \epsilon$) from raw telemetry. Features adaptive drift detection to recalibrate probability surfaces in real-time.

*   **Flux — The Kinetic-Entropy Protocol**
    Dual-core simulation engine for adversarial zero-sum systems (Sports/Gaming). Integrates **Kinetic Force** (DVOA/Efficiency) with **Entropic Friction** (Time/Decay) to predict "Grind vs. Snap" outcomes and systemic collapse.

*   **Vantage — The Macro Regime Compass**
    Stochastic regime classifier for financial markets. Measures the velocity of **Global Liquidity** against **Volatility** to identify market states (Melt-Up, Bull, Stall, Crash) and vector direction.

*   **Apex Expert Core — Intelligence Orchestration**
    High-frequency execution wrapper and strategic decision substrate. Acts as the hybrid layer bridging Python logic with execution endpoints (WebSockets/API).
