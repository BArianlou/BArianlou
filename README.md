## Technical Frameworks

### Apex Expert 2.0 — Hybrid Intelligence Architecture  
A multi-layer intelligence synthesis engine using M9–M10 architecture for data orchestration, decision support, and strategic campaign design.  
**Status:** Documentation public · Core logic proprietary · Access by alignment only.

### Chronos — RL Liquidity Execution Framework  
Reinforcement-driven framework for **institutional liquidity execution** and **slippage optimization**. Focused on execution sequencing, market impact modeling, and adaptive policy learning in adversarial microstructure environments.  
**Status:** Public framework · Research-grade RL engine.

### Sypher — Post-Quantum Cryptographic Framework  
Post-quantum cryptographic framework fusing **Kyber-style KEM** with **AES-256-GCM** and RL-driven adversarial resilience. Targets secure key exchange, encrypted channels, and robustness against adaptive threat models.  
**Status:** Public framework · PQC + adversarial resilience.

### Vantage — Stochastic Physics-Integrated Predictive Engine
The first production-grade synthesis of the **Apex** (Ingestion) and **Chronos** (Simulation) frameworks. A generalizable predictive framework built on **Stochastic Physics-Integrated Predictive Analysis (SPIPA)**. Models complex competitive systems as dynamic physical environments characterized by energy states, transition potentials, and entropy.

*   **Core Logic:** Integrates **Apex** data orchestration with **Chronos** Monte Carlo kernels to transform raw telemetry into physics-aligned state representations (10,000 runs/event).
*   **Validation Case:** Currently deployed on **NFL datasets** as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate probabilistic arbitrage capabilities against institutional baselines.
*   **Status:** Private engine · White Paper released · Core logic sealed.
### Flux — Cybernetic Entropic Simulation Engine

A general-purpose recursive state machine designed to model friction, decay, and entropy in complex adaptive systems. Unlike standard regression models that predict destination, Flux simulates the journey by accounting for **Path Dependency**, **Hysteresis**, and **Cybernetic Feedback Loops**.

*   **Core Logic:** Operates as a closed-loop reactor. Inputs static potential energy (from Vantage) and processes it through a **Stochastic Transition Kernel** to simulate system decay and critical failures (e.g., liquidity cascades, supply chain bottlenecks, turnover spirals).
*   **Validation Case:** Utilized as the "Chronos" layer to resolve high-variance anomalies in competitive game theory, successfully identifying "Tail Risks" that statistical averages miss.
*   **Status:** Architecture public · Core logic sealed · Multi-domain application (Finance, Cyber, Logistics).

## Sealed Engines (Private Deployment)

These systems are **operational, versioned, and banked**, with logic retained as proprietary assets.

- **Vantage v1.1 (Dual-Vector)** — NFL arbitrage engine (EPA + Monte Carlo, Alpha+ reporting, integrity-checked).  
- **Apex Expert Core** — Intelligence orchestration and strategic decision substrate (beyond public documentation scope).
