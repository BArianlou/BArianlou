## Technical Frameworks

### Apex Expert 2.0 — Hybrid Intelligence Architecture  
A multi-layer intelligence synthesis engine using M9–M10 architecture for data orchestration, decision support, and strategic campaign design.  
**Status:** Documentation public · Core logic proprietary · Access by alignment only.

### Chronos — RL Liquidity Execution Framework  
Reinforcement-driven framework for **institutional liquidity execution** and **slippage optimization**. Focused on execution sequencing, market impact modeling, and adaptive policy learning in adversarial microstructure environments.  
**Status:** Public framework · Research-grade RL engine.

### Sypher — Post-Quantum Cryptographic Framework  
Post-quantum cryptographic framework fusing **Kyber-style KEM** with **AES-256-GCM** and RL-driven adversarial resilience. Targets secure key exchange, encrypted channels, and robustness against adaptive threat models.  
**Status:** Public framework · PQC + adversarial resilience.

###  Vantage — Stochastic Physics-Integrated Predictive Engine  
A generalizable predictive framework built on Stochastic Physics-Integrated Predictive Analysis (SPIPA). Models complex competitive systems as dynamic physical environments characterized by energy states, transition potentials, and entropy.
Core Logic: Transforms raw telemetry into physics-aligned state representations to feed high-volume Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 runs/event).
Validation Case: Currently deployed on NFL datasets as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate probabilistic arbitrage capabilities against institutional baselines.
Status: Private engine · White Paper released · Core logic sealed.  
**Status:** Private engine · Documentation + benchmarks deployed · Core logic sealed.

## Sealed Engines (Private Deployment)

These systems are **operational, versioned, and banked**, with logic retained as proprietary assets.

- **Vantage v1.1 (Dual-Vector)** — NFL arbitrage engine (EPA + Monte Carlo, Alpha+ reporting, integrity-checked).  
- **Apex Expert Core** — Intelligence orchestration and strategic decision substrate (beyond public documentation scope).
