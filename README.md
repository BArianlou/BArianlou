**Systems Architecture · Intelligence Synthesis · Cryptographic Frameworks**

This repository serves as the central ledger for the **2026 technical release cycle**, consolidating the primary frameworks and engines developed during the **2025 R&D phase**. It tracks public documentation artifacts, active research lines, and sealed production-grade systems.

## Technical Frameworks

### Apex Expert 2.0 — Hybrid Intelligence Architecture  
A multi-layer intelligence synthesis engine using M9–M10 architecture for data orchestration, decision support, and strategic campaign design.  
**Status:** Documentation public · Core logic proprietary · Access by alignment only.

### Chronos — RL Liquidity Execution Framework  
Reinforcement-driven framework for **institutional liquidity execution** and **slippage optimization**. Focused on execution sequencing, market impact modeling, and adaptive policy learning in adversarial microstructure environments.  
**Status:** Public framework · Research-grade RL engine.

### Sypher — Post-Quantum Cryptographic Framework  
Post-quantum cryptographic framework fusing **Kyber-style KEM** with **AES-256-GCM** and RL-driven adversarial resilience. Targets secure key exchange, encrypted channels, and robustness against adaptive threat models.  
**Status:** Public framework · PQC + adversarial resilience.

### Vantage — Quantitative NFL Arbitrage Engine  
EPA-driven **Monte Carlo arbitrage engine** for NFL markets. Uses physics-based metrics and a Triune architecture (Apex ingestion, Chronos simulation, Vantage scanner) to generate **True Spread / True Total** and detect pricing inefficiencies vs sportsbook lines.  
**Status:** Private engine · Documentation + benchmarks deployed · Core logic sealed.

## Sealed Engines (Private Deployment)

These systems are **operational, versioned, and banked**, with logic retained as proprietary warheads.

- **Vantage v1.1 (Dual-Vector)** — NFL arbitrage engine (EPA + Monte Carlo, Alpha+ reporting, integrity-checked).  
- **Apex Expert Core** — Intelligence orchestration and strategic decision substrate (beyond public documentation scope).

Chronos remains a **public RL framework**, not a sealed engine.
